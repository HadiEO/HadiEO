- 👋 Hi, I’m @HadiEO .
- 👀 I’m interested in remote sensing, forest carbon, (geospatial) data science, cloud-native geo (Google Earth Engine, Microsoft Planetary Computer (Pangeo)), machine learning (ML), statistical inference, process-based models, and human-centric data-centric ML
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud-native geospatial Python (Pangeo stack).
